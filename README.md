# Face-Mask-Detection-Model
Mask detector for a single person in image

This a project work done using python convolutional neural network for recognizing the people in public who are not wearing mask.
It is based on the Convolutional neural Networks for classification of the images captured which are present in captured format. This could be further extended to realtime detection of face mask with the usage of openCV library and some other functionalities of Keras and TensorFlow. The code for the project is provided in the “mask-detector.ipynb” file with the training and testing dataset present in respective folders.
